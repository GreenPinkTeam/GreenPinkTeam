We take privacy very seriously. 
We know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

We do not collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app preferences, save file, high scores) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you have any concerns about your privacy while playing our games, please contact us with any questions and we will help you as quickly as possible.
Have fun, Enjoy our games.
